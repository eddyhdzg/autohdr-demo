# Object Removal

Clean up your real estate photos by removing unwanted items like
trash cans, cars, yard signs, or personal belongings.

## Common removals

- Trash cans and recycling bins
- Cars in driveways
- Real estate signs from competing agents
- Personal photos and clutter
- Construction equipment
- Hoses and garden tools

## How to request object removal

When uploading your photos, mark the items you want removed. AutoHDR's
AI fills in the background naturally using surrounding context.

<Warning>
  Object removal works best for smaller objects with a clear background.
  Removing large objects (like a car taking up 50% of the frame) may
  produce less natural results.
</Warning>
