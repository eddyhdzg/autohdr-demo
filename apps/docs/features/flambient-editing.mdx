# Flambient Editing

Flambient (flash + ambient) is the gold standard for interior real estate
photography. AutoHDR blends your flash and ambient exposures automatically.

## What is flambient?

Flambient photography combines two types of shots:

- **Ambient:** Natural light exposures that capture the mood and warmth
- **Flash:** Strobe-lit exposures that fill shadows and add detail

AutoHDR's AI blends these together, keeping the natural feel of ambient
light while using the flash exposure to fill in dark areas.

## How to upload flambient shots

Upload both your ambient brackets and flash frame together. AutoHDR
detects which frames are flash-lit and blends them automatically.

<Tip>
  Label your flash frames clearly in your file naming convention so you
  can easily review AutoHDR's work.
