# Virtual Staging

Transform empty rooms into beautifully staged spaces. AutoHDR's virtual
staging adds realistic furniture, decor, and accessories to help buyers
visualize the space.

## When to use virtual staging

- Vacant properties
- New construction without model furniture
- Rooms that need a style refresh for listing photos

## Room types supported

- Living rooms
- Bedrooms
- Dining rooms
- Home offices
- Kitchens (countertop staging)

## How it works

1. Upload your photo of an empty room
2. Select **Virtual Staging**
3. AutoHDR adds furniture and decor that matches the room's style,
   size, and lighting
4. Review and download your staged photo

<Info>
  Virtual staging should be disclosed in your listing per NAR guidelines.
  Include a note that photos are "virtually staged" in your listing description.
