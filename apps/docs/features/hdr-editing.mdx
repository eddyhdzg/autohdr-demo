# HDR Editing

AutoHDR's core feature. Upload your bracketed exposures and receive
professionally balanced HDR photos — the same quality as a manual editor,
delivered in minutes.

## How it works

AutoHDR's AI was trained on over 1 million professionally edited real estate
photos. It automatically:

- Groups your bracketed exposures
- Balances highlight and shadow detail
- Corrects white balance and color temperature
- Applies natural-looking tone mapping
- Straightens vertical lines and corrects lens distortion

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Shoot 3-5 brackets per frame">
    AutoHDR works best with 3-5 exposure brackets per frame.
    This gives the AI enough dynamic range data to produce natural results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use a tripod">
    Consistent framing between brackets produces the best HDR merges.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include window pulls">
    For interior shots with bright windows, include a dark exposure
    that captures the outdoor view. AutoHDR will blend it naturally.
