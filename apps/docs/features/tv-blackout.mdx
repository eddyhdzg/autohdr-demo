# TV Blackout

Black TV screens are distracting in listing photos. AutoHDR automatically
detects TVs and replaces the black screen with subtle, lifestyle-appropriate
content or a clean dark screen that doesn't reflect the room.

## How it works

AutoHDR scans your photos for TV screens and applies a clean treatment
automatically. No manual marking required.

<Tip>
  TV Blackout is included automatically on Pro plans and above. It's applied
  to all photos where a TV is detected.
