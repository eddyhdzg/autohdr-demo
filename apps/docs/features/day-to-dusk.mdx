# Day to Dusk

Turn your daytime exterior photos into dramatic twilight (dusk) shots.
AutoHDR adds a realistic sunset sky, warm interior lighting, and
landscape lighting effects.

## When to use day-to-dusk

- Exterior shots taken during the day that need more drama
- Listings where a twilight shoot wasn't possible
- Marketing materials that need a premium feel

## How it works

1. Upload your daytime exterior photo
2. Select **Day to Dusk** as the editing style
3. AutoHDR replaces the sky with a realistic sunset
4. Interior windows are lit with warm, inviting light
5. Landscape and pathway lighting is added naturally

<Warning>
  Day-to-dusk works best with photos that have a clear sky line
  and visible windows. Complex tree canopies or obstructed views
  may produce less natural results.
</Warning>
