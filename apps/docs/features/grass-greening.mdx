# Grass Greening

Make brown or patchy lawns look lush and green. AutoHDR's grass greening
feature enhances landscaping while keeping the result natural-looking.

## When to use grass greening

- Drought-affected lawns
- Seasonal brown grass
- New construction with immature landscaping
- Photos taken during winter months

## How it works

AutoHDR detects lawn and grass areas in your photos and enhances the
color saturation and vibrancy. The result is a natural-looking green
lawn that matches the rest of the scene.

<Info>
  Grass greening is applied automatically when needed. You can also
  specifically request it when uploading your photos.
