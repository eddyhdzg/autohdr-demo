# Edit Your First Photos

Get professionally edited real estate photos in three simple steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your free account">
    Go to [AutoHDR](https://autohdr.vercel.app) and sign up with your Google account.
    You get 10 free photos every month — no credit card required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload your photos">
    Drag and drop your photos into the AutoHDR Studio, or upload from Dropbox.
    AutoHDR accepts JPG files up to 20 MB each. You can upload as many photos as
    you want — you only pay for what you download.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download your results">
    AutoHDR processes your photos using AI trained on over 1 million professionally
    edited images. Most photos are ready within minutes. Review side-by-side
    comparisons and download the ones you want.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Upload your entire shoot at once. AutoHDR automatically groups bracketed exposures
  and applies the right settings for each photo.
