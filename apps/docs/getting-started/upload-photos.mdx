# Upload Your Photos

AutoHDR accepts photos through the Studio web interface or via integrations
like Dropbox and Spiro.

## Upload via Studio

1. Log in to your AutoHDR account
2. Open the **Studio**
3. Drag and drop your photos, or click **Upload** to browse your computer
4. AutoHDR automatically detects bracketed exposures and groups them

  You can upload as many photos as you want. AutoHDR only charges you for
  the photos you choose to download.

## Upload via Dropbox

If you've connected Dropbox, simply save your photos to your designated
AutoHDR folder. They'll be automatically picked up and processed.
