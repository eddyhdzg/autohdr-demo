# Pricing

AutoHDR uses a simple credit-based pricing model.
**You only pay for photos you download.**

Upload as many photos as you want. Preview them, compare side-by-side,
and only pay when you're ready to download.

## Key pricing principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload unlimited, pay only for downloads">
    Upload and preview as many photos as you want. You're only charged
    when you download an edited photo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Top up credits at your plan rate">
    On any paid plan, you can purchase additional credits at the same
    per-photo rate as your plan. A Basic plan user buying extra credits
    still pays $0.57/photo, not the free tier rate.

  <Accordion title="Save 20% with annual billing">
    Switch to yearly billing and save 20% on any Pro plan.
