# How Credits Work

AutoHDR uses a credit system. One credit = one downloaded photo.

## Monthly credits

Your plan includes a set number of credits each month. Unused credits
on Pro plans roll over to the next month.

## Topping up

Need more credits than your plan includes? You can purchase additional
credits at any time at your plan's per-photo rate.

<Info>
  **Example:** On the Basic plan ($0.57/photo), you get 50 credits/month.
  If you need 120 credits one month, you can buy 70 extra at $0.57 each —
  the same rate as your plan, not the free tier rate of $0.80.
</Info>

## Free plan credits

On the free plan, you get 10 credits per month. Additional photos
cost $0.80 each, pay-as-you-go.
