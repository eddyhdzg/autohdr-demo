# Spiro Integration

Connect AutoHDR to Spiro for fully automated photo editing. Once set up,
Spiro automatically sends photos to AutoHDR and receives edited results
back — no manual uploads needed.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Claim your free credits">
    Visit Spiro's AutoHDR integration page and claim 30 complimentary editing
    credits to test the service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Google">
    Sign in with the Google account associated with your AutoHDR account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add AutoHDR as an external editor">
    In Spiro settings, go to External Editors and click **+ Add New**.
    Select AutoHDR from the list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your services">
    Choose which Spiro services should use AutoHDR for photo editing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    Save your settings. Spiro will create a "Photo Editing [AutoHDR]" task
    for your selected services automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works after setup

1. You complete a photo shoot and upload to Spiro as normal
2. Spiro automatically creates an AutoHDR editing task
3. Photos are sent to AutoHDR for processing
4. Edited photos are delivered back to Spiro within ~30 minutes
5. Photos appear in your Spiro project, ready for client delivery

## Dropbox integration

For the smoothest workflow, set up Dropbox sync with both Spiro and AutoHDR.
Photos flow automatically: **Dropbox → AutoHDR → Spiro → Client**.

See [Dropbox Integration](/integrations/dropbox) for setup details.
