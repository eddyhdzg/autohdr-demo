# Dropbox Integration

Connect your Dropbox account to AutoHDR for automatic photo uploads.
Save photos to your designated folder and AutoHDR picks them up automatically.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Dropbox">
    In your AutoHDR account settings, click **Connect Dropbox** and
    authorize access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your folder">
    AutoHDR creates a designated folder in your Dropbox. Any photos
    saved to this folder are automatically uploaded for editing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload and wait">
    Drop your shoot photos into the folder. AutoHDR processes them
    and notifies you when they're ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Combine Dropbox with the Spiro integration for a fully automated
  workflow: shoot → Dropbox → AutoHDR → Spiro → client delivery.
