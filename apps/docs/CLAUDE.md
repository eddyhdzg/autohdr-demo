# AutoHDR Documentation - AI Writing Guidelines

## Project

- Mintlify docs site for AutoHDR (AI real estate photo editing)
- MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json

## Content Strategy

- Accuracy first — only document real features
- Write for real estate photographers (not developers)
- Keep language simple, action-oriented
- Every page should have a clear "what you'll learn" or "what you'll do"

## Writing Standards

- Use second person ("you") to address the reader
- Use present tense
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
- Include screenshots/images where helpful
- Always include alt text for images

## Frontmatter

Every MDX file must include:

- title (required)
- description (required, 1-2 sentences for SEO)
- icon (optional, from Lucide icons)

## Terminology

- "photos" not "images" (matches industry language)
- "download" not "export" (matches the product UX)
- "credits" for pricing units
- "shoot" for a batch of photos from one property
